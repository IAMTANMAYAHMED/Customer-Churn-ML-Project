Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using various machine learning models. The goal is to help companies identify customers likely to churn and take proactive steps to retain them.

## Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Training and Evaluation
3. Performance Comparison

## How to Run:
- Run the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` to clean the dataset and prepare it for model training.
- Run the `model_training.ipynb` to train and evaluate different models.

## Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results:
The best performing model is Random Forest with an accuracy of 86%.
